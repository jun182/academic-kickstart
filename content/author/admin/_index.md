I'm Johnny. I'm currently active as the Vice chairman of the IT-section at Göta student union, and is finishing my thesis in the Informatics programme at the Department of Applied IT of the University of Gothenburg.

Next semester I'll be starting the Interaction Design and Technology MSc programme at Chalmers, and will continue on as Chairman of the IT-section during this time.
