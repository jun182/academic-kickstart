Hello there.
--------------

I'm Johnny. I'm currently active as the Chairman of the IT-section at Göta student union, and is a MSc student at the Interaction Design and Technologies programme at Chalmers University, studying Computer Science and HCI. I have also recently graduated from the Informatics programme at the Department of Applied IT of the University of Gothenburg. 

In addition to this I have also worked as a TA for various courses in Informatics and Programming at the IT-faculty.
