Hello there.
--------------

I'm Johnny. I'm currently active as the Vice chairman of the IT-section at Göta student union, and is also finishing my thesis in the Informatics programme at the Department of Applied IT of the University of Gothenburg.

In addition to this I'm also working as a TA for the System Development Project course TIG059.

#This coming year I'll be a part of the Interaction Design and Technology MSc programme at Chalmers, and will continue on as Chairman of the #IT-section during this time.
